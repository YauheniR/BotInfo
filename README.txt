# BotInfo
My first python project. Optimizes work with the client for the delivery of goods. Reads html files in the directory and converts them to the format:
Client name.
Client's phone number.
A link in the navigator to the client's location.
Sorts data by delivery time.
Data in a convenient format is sent to the telegram bot.
The application allows you to spend less time processing orders manually. And it allows you not to be distracted from your main work.
